DNA vaccines are among the types being tested to prevent COVID-19. DNA vaccines may offer an advantage to other types of vaccines because they do not need to use the virus to produce an immune response. Other DNA vaccines in development (including for influenza, HPV, and HIV) have been extensively tested in animals and people and shown to be safe.

Some people are concerned that DNA vaccines could change people’s existing DNA. While it is the case that the DNA from the vaccine is treated the same as human DNA in the cell, two points are worth considering. First, DNA vaccines have not historically worked as well as other types because it is difficult to get enough DNA introduced to the vaccine recipient to make a strong immune response. Second, even when it is introduced successfully, vaccine DNA only enters a few cells, which then produce viral proteins that, once released from the cell, activate the immune system to generate immunity.

As such, concerns related to a person’s DNA being altered by DNA vaccines are theoretical concerns without evidence. Since all vaccines are required to go through extensive testing before approval, the same standard will be applied to DNA vaccines as will be applied to any other COVID-19 vaccine. Only then will we know whether DNA vaccines will be useful in protecting against COVID-19.
