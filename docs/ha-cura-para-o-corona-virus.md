No cure for coronavirus is available.

**People who are mildly ill and recovering at home**  
Rest and drinking plenty of fluids are most important for people with mild cases of COVID-19. While over-the-counter medications can be used to make a person more comfortable, it is important to realize that often symptoms are the result of the immune response to infection. For example, fevers make the body a less “comfortable” environment for the virus to reproduce and allow the immune system to work better. So, treating fever can prolong illness. To learn more about fever, [**check out this downloadable question-and-answer sheet**](https://media.chop.edu/data/files/pdfs/vaccine-education-center-infectious-diseases-fevers.pdf), or to find out more about fever and vaccines, [**check out this webpage.**](https://www.chop.edu/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-safety/fever-and-vaccines)

Those recovering at home should be in touch with their healthcare provider for specific medical recommendations, and a**nyone having trouble breathing, or who quickly takes a turn for the worse, should seek immediate medical care.** A monoclonal antibody treatment, called bamlanivimab, was recently approved for treatment of mild-to-moderate disease in those with high risk conditions.

It is also important for those with mild illness to still isolate from others in the home as they can still spread the virus.

**People who are severely ill and require hospitalization**  
Healthcare providers have been learning more about ways to treat people who become severely ill. One medication, Remdesivir, has been shown to shorten the length of infection. Similarly, a drug called dexamethasone (a steroid) has been shown to be of benefit for people with pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2.

Treatment of hospitalized patients varies based on the symptoms and complications each patient experiences.
