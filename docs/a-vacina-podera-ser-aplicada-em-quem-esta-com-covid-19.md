People who currently have COVID-19 should wait until they have recovered and [**meet the criteria to stop isolating.**](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/isolation.html)

If a person had antibody therapy as part of their treatment, they should wait for 3 months before getting the vaccine.
