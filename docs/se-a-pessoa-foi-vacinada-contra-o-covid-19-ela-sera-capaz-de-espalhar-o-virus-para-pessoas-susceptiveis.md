People will not spread the virus after vaccination with the mRNA vaccines since they are not live vaccines that reproduce the whole virus in the body.

But, we do not yet know if the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines prevent infection or if they only prevent disease:

* Disease means people experience symptoms of illness.
* Infection means that a virus can infect a person’s cells and reproduce, but the person may or may not have symptoms or be contagious.

If the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines only prevent disease, a person could be infected following an exposure and potentially spread the virus. Additional studies will be completed to determine whether the vaccines prevent infection as well as disease. However, given this uncertainty, vaccinated people will still need to use masks and practice social distancing measures for some time.
