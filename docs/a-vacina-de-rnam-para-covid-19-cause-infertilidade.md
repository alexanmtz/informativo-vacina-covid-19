Infertility has not been found to be an issue in women infected with COVID-19, so it would not be expected to be a concern for the vaccine.

Concerns about antibodies generated by the COVID-19 vaccine attacking syncytin-1, a protein associated with the placenta during pregnancy, are unfounded. The claims, which circulated online, were based on a small number of similar amino acids in the two proteins, but the overlap is not sufficient to cause such a reaction. This notion has been addressed by [**Full Fact**](https://fullfact.org/health/vaccine-covid-fertility/).
