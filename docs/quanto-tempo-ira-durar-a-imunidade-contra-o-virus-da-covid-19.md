We do not yet know how long immunity lasts after infection or vaccination:

Infection - Scientists are working to learn more about immunity following infection. While some people have been re-infected after recovering from COVID-19, the number of people who have experienced this is small compared with the total number of people who have been infected. Likewise, although the virus has been changing since it was first recognized, antibodies from people who were sick early during the pandemic are still effective against the slightly modified version. For these reasons, scientists are hopeful that people will be protected for one or more years.

Vaccination - Clinical trial participants will be monitored to understand how long immunity lasts after vaccination.
