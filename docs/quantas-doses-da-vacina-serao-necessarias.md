The mRNA vaccines require two doses. For the Pfizer vaccine, doses should be separated by 21 days. For Moderna’s vaccine, doses should be separated by 28 days. The two mRNA vaccines are not interchangeable. A person should be sure they know which one they got as the first dose and be clear about when they should return for the second dose, particularly because the vaccines require both doses to have the best protection.

Some COVID-19 vaccines being evaluated only require a single dose, but the clinical trials will provide more information about how many doses of each vaccine will be needed.
