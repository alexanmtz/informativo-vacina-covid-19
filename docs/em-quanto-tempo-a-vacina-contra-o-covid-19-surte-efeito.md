At least at first, COVID-19 vaccines are not be interchangeable.

Three scenarios can occur if a person gets vaccinated with two versions of vaccines against the same disease, particularly close in time:

* **They get a stronger immune response.** An example of this was when children got inactivated polio vaccine and later got oral polio vaccine.
* **The second vaccine causes immunity that would be similar to receiving a second dose of the original vaccine.** Using a different brand of hepatitis B vaccine for one or more doses would be an example of this.
* **The immune response generated by the first vaccine interferes with components of the response to the second vaccine, in some cases causing lower immunity.** For example, when people got a pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV) followed by a pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine with a harmless helper protein attached to it, called pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV), they had lower antibody responses to one part of the PCV vaccine than people who got the two vaccines in the opposite order (PCV followed by PPSV).

For these reasons, studies will need to be done to determine the effects of getting a second type of COVID-19 vaccine shortly after receiving a different one. If, however, we find that COVID-19 vaccines are like influenza vaccines and we need to get vaccinated annually, concerns about switching types from one year to the next are less likely to be an issue.
