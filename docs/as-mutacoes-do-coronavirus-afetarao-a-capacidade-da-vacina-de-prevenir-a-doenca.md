Viral mutations can cause vaccines to be less effective, such as we see with the influenza virus, so it is reasonable to wonder whether changes to SARS-CoV-2 will affect COVID-19 vaccines. Although SARS-CoV-2 is constantly mutating, the critical question is does the virus’s mutation change function, making the virus more or less virulent or more or less contagious. So far, the virus that causes COVID-19 does not appear to have functionally changed in an important way. But, it does happen and at some point a change could affect how well a vaccine works. Right now, that does not appear to be happening. For example, recent changes enabled the virus to spread more easily, but those changes do not appear to make people sicker and the vaccine appears to protect against the newer version. Likewise, antibodies from people who had an earlier version of the virus are still able to protect against the newer version. In other words, at least to date, the virus hasn’t mutated away from the approach taken to combat COVID-19 with vaccines.
