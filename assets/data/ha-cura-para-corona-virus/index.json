While over-the-counter medications can be used to make a person more comfortable, it is important to realize that often symptoms are the result of the immune response to infection. For example, fevers make the body a less “comfortable” environment for the virus to reproduce and allow the immune system to work better. So, treating fever can prolong illness.

One medication, Remdesivir, has been shown to shorten the length of infection. Similarly, a drug called dexamethasone (a steroid) has been shown to be of benefit for people with pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2.</p>\n<p>Treatment of hospitalized patients varies based on the symptoms and complications each patient experiences.</p>\n"}},"context":{}}
