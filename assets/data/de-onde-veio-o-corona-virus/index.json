This new virus had two important characteristics. First, it could cause severe disease and death in people. Second, it could easily spread from one person to another. Together with the fact that no one in the world was immune, these characteristics set the stage for the COVID-19 pandemic that quickly changed current life as we knew it.</p>\n<p>As scientists around the world have diligently worked to help us understand this virus and the disease it causes, it is important to realize that we will continue to learn more about this virus for many years to come. But, we have learned some important things already:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For many people, disease will be mild. Some people will not experience any detectable symptoms. But, this is not true for everyone, and, as with other infections, science has not evolved to a point that we can predict who will become severely ill, experience complications, or die. This means, everyone should take the virus seriously — if not for themselves, then for those around them.</li>\n<li>In some cases, groups of people are known to be at greater risk of suffering severe COVID-19. These include older adults and people of color as well as sub-groups of the population, like those with heart and lung disease, obesity, type-2 diabetes, and pregnant women.</li>\n<li>And, for some people symptoms last extremely long, and lingering, long-term effects may also result, although this is another area that healthcare providers and scientists are still working to understand.</li>\n<li>Finally, while healthcare providers are learning more every day about how to treat COVID-19, many medications and treatments are still being studied.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For these reasons, and because prevention is better than treatment, COVID-19 vaccines are essential to returning to some sense of normalcy. But, we can also work together using important public health practices to limit the illness, deaths, and societal damage SARS-CoV-2 seeks to sow.</p>\n"}},"context":{}}
