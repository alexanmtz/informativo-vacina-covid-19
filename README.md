# ![Jamdocs](https://github.com/samuelhorn/jamdocs/blob/master/src/assets/img/logo-dark.svg)

The ultimate static generated documentation theme for the JAM-stack. Highly customizable, based on Gridsome, ready to deploy to Netlify in one click. [DEMO](https://jamdocs.samuelhorn.com/)

_Beware, Jamdocs is still in heavy development and will probably change a lot in the near future. And the docs for it is still not completed._

## Fast by default

Jamdocs is optimized to be as fast as possible, right now generating 100/100/100/100 score in Google Lighthouse. And 100/100 score in Google Page Speed Insights.
